EasyQuickImport is a tool that helps you import invoices, bills, transactions,
customers and vendors into QuickBooks Desktop in multiple currencies in bulk.

### Features
- **Invoices, bills, transactions (General Journal entries), customers, and vendors import in csv, xlsx, xls formats.**
- **Multicurrency support with NON-USD base currency**. The currency of your accounts is automatically detected
  from the imported Chart of accounts. 
- **Cross Currency Transactions**. Transfer between accounts of different currencies goes through the Undeposited
  funds account. The Undeposited funds balance remains zero because EasyQuickImport uses the accurate historical exchange rate.
- **Historical exchange rate**. EasyQuickImport automatically obtains the exchange rate from European Central Bank
  on a given date for any currency for each transaction. You can use [other exchange rate sources](https://github.com/florianv/exchanger) as well.
- **Multi-tenancy**: if you have multiple company files on the same computer, you can add them all to EasyQuickImport.
